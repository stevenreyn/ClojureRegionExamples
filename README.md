# ClojureRegionExamples #

Examples showing use of RegionViewer on some Clojure collections. Depends on the 
project RegionViewer and Clojure.  Tested with Clojure 1.5.1. 

You should first read the documentation for the
[RegionViewer project](http://stevenreyn.github.io/RegionViewer). These Clojure 
examples are in src/ClojureRegionExamples. The most basic example is data.clj.
To run it, you will need to have your IDE setup with Clojure and include the RegionViewer
project in your classpath. Alternatively you can use leiningen with RegionViewer
in your classpath.

The other examples depend on a function defined in data.clj so you should load
that file first in your REPL.
