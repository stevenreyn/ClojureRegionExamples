# ClojureRegionExamples #

Examples showing use of RegionViewer on some Clojure collections. Depends on the 
project RegionViewer and Clojure.  Tested with Clojure 1.5.1. 

You should first read the documentation for the
[RegionViewer project](http://stevenreyn.github.io/RegionViewer). These Clojure 
examples are in src/ClojureRegionExamples. The most basic example is data.clj.
To run it, you will need to have your IDE setup with Clojure and include the RegionViewer
project in your classpath. This project has not yet been configured to use leiningen.
If you do want to use leiningen, you will need to have RegionViewer
in your classpath.

The examples from the other files depend on a function defined in data.clj. So you should load
data.clj first in your REPL.
